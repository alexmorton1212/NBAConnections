NOTES:

- nba_connections.csv is an output and an input. I created it based on the given inputs and later used it again as an input itself.

- season_details.csv was not downloaded outright. I scraped it from the url listed and compiled it as a csv.

- connections_final_roster.csv, connections_full_roster.csv, and season_outcomes.csv can be used for the analysis portion.

- The visualization portion of the project uses a separate JSON file that combines elements of these associated inputs and outputs. It is available in the ‘Visualization’ folder.
